Utilities for debugging
#######################
:category: Linux, MacOSX, Windows

Part of my daily job involves getting dirty at the assembler level, generally
to debug segfaults, FPE, deadlocks and similar stuff. It's a fascinating
challenge which makes me feel extremely powerful and in control of the hard,
low-level technicalities of the OS, libraries and hardware I use. Most of my
effort, however, would be impossible without a few tools I learned to
appreciate and love through hours of solid dependency. I'm posting them here,
and while the list is certainly not exhaustive, it's a starting kit for the
hardcore debugger.

Linux
-----

c++filt
~~~~~~~

This nifty utility converts C++ mangled symbols into the unmangled form. A
simple example is the following

::

   $ c++filt _ZNK3MPI4File19Get_position_sharedEv
   MPI::File::Get_position_shared() const

More complex symbols can become unreadable in the mangled form, especially when
they arise from template instantiation. A quick pass with ``c++filt`` will make
everything much clearer.

pmap
~~~~

Another nifty utility in the Linux arsenal, this easy program reports the VM
layout of a running process.

::

   $ pmap  21102
   21102:   cat
   0000000000400000     44K r-x--  /bin/cat
   000000000060a000      4K r----  /bin/cat
   000000000060b000      4K rw---  /bin/cat
   0000000001969000    132K rw---    [ anon ]
   00007f3b98aa9000   7068K r----  /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
   00007f3b99190000   1748K r-x--  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so
   00007f3b99345000   2048K -----  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so
   00007f3b99545000     16K r----  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so
   00007f3b99549000      8K rw---  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so
   00007f3b9954b000     20K rw---    [ anon ]
   00007f3b99550000    136K r-x--  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.15.so
   00007f3b99749000     12K rw---    [ anon ]
   00007f3b99770000      8K rw---    [ anon ]
   00007f3b99772000      4K r----  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.15.so
   00007f3b99773000      8K rw---  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.15.so
   00007fff18ae9000    136K rw---    [ stack ]
   00007fff18bff000      4K r-x--    [ anon ]
   ffffffffff600000      4K r-x--    [ anon ]
    total            11404K

To achieve the same with a post-mortem core file, the gdb commands "info files"
and "maintenance info sections" are your friends. When running, "info proc
mappings" can achieve the same.

lddtree
~~~~~~~

``lddtree`` is like ``ldd``, but it traverses the full hierarchy, building a tree diagram of all dependencies. 
It is available on Ubuntu in the package pax-utils.

::

   $ lddtree /bin/ls
   ls => /bin/ls (interpreter => /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2)
       libselinux.so.1 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1
           libdl.so.2 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2
           ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/ld-linux.so.2
       librt.so.1 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/librt.so.1
           libpthread.so.0 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0
       libacl.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libacl.so.1
           libattr.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libattr.so.1
       libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6


Windows
-------

I am not a Windows person, but I build and debug on it rather often. With time,
I gathered a few essential tools to understand the source of your problems
during build, deployment and execution.

`Process monitor <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reports events of different nature from all the processes in your system, such
as disk access, registry access, and so on. I found this utility fundamental to
track a strange crash that occurred in a third party closed-source library. The
problem turned out to be an attempt to write to a directory that was not
writable. From the website:

   Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time
   file system, Registry and process/thread activity. It combines the features of
   two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive
   list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering,
   comprehensive event properties such session IDs and user names, reliable
   process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each
   operation, simultaneous logging to a file, and much more. Its uniquely powerful
   features will make Process Monitor a core utility in your system
   troubleshooting and malware hunting toolkit.

`Process Explorer <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An equivalent of ``fuser`` on Linux. From the website:

   Ever wondered which program has a particular file or directory open? Now you
   can find out. Process Explorer shows you information about which handles and
   DLLs processes have opened or loaded.

`VMMap <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd535533.aspx>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extremely useful tool to see the Virtual Memory layout. It is precious to check
potential fragmentation scenarios that could lead to invalid allocations.

From the website:

   VMMap is a process virtual and physical memory analysis utility. It shows a
   breakdown of a process's committed virtual memory types as well as the amount
   of physical memory (working set) assigned by the operating system to those
   types. Besides graphical representations of memory usage, VMMap also shows
   summary information and a detailed process memory map.

`Dependency walker <http://www.dependencywalker.com/>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Performs more or less the task of ``lddtree`` on Linux and ``otool`` on Mac.
It's invaluable to figure our which libraries or symbols are unresolved. I soon
discovered that Windows is not very verbose when it comes to unresolved
dependencies at startup. From the website:

   Dependency Walker is a free utility that scans any 32-bit or 64-bit Windows
   module (exe, dll, ocx, sys, etc.) and builds a hierarchical tree diagram of all
   dependent modules. For each module found, it lists all the functions that are
   exported by that module, and which of those functions are actually being called
   by other modules. Another view displays the minimum set of required files,
   along with detailed information about each file including a full path to the
   file, base address, version numbers, machine type, debug information, and
   more.

`Event Viewer <http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/open-event-viewer#1TC=windows-7>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provided on a standard windows 7 installation. Another invaluable tool to
understand what's going on in your program, reports error and anomalous
conditions that prevent an application to start, and much
more.
