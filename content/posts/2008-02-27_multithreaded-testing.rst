Suppose you have to perform tests. Lots of tests. Functional tests,
where each test could take a lot of time.
Suppose also that

-  you don't want to wait three days until your tests are done
-  you have a massively parallel architecture available
-  you are using python unittest framework
-  you enjoy colors

What would you do?

You install `testoob <http://testoob.sourceforge.net/>`_. This thing is
life-changing, believe me.
So, let's see an example. Suppose you have this test:

::

    import unittest
    import time
    class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        def testFoo(self):
            time.sleep(3)
            self.assertEqual(0,0)
        def testBar(self): 
            time.sleep(5)
            self.assertEqual(0,0)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()

If you run it, the whole testcase will take 8 seconds.

::

    ..
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 2 tests in 8.000s

    OK

But if you install testoob, now you have a nice executable

::

    stefano$ testoob test.py 
    ..
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 2 tests in 8.001s
    OK

Here is the magic: run it with the option --threads=2 and the result is
served in just 5 seconds:

::

    stefano$ testoob --threads=2 test.py 
    ..
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 2 tests in 5.001s
    OK

Ok, but what about the colors? Well, I like the testing suites that
print out something green for every successful test. testoob does it, so
it brings way more fun and enjoyment!

Testoob does a lot more. If you feel limited by the current unittest
module, you should definitely consider to take a look at testoob.
