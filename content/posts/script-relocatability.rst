I wrote the first part of some research I did on `script
relocatability <http://forthescience.org/wiki/Script%20relocatability>`_.
The basic problem is to make a script and its resources relocatable. It
is not meant to be correct, actually I believe there are many errors and
inaccuracies, but it brings a lot of arguments to discuss. I will write
the second part (which will try to answer the questions at the end of
the first part) as soon as I can manage to find some time to continue
the exploration.
