I am reading with much pleasure `The Art of SQL
<http://www.amazon.com/Art-SQL-Stephane-Faroult/dp/0596008945>`_ , by Stephane
Faroult. It's a masterpiece for advanced SQL usage. The book is far from
redundant in the wide selection of literature for SQL, and it's not aimed at
beginners. In fact, it's definitely targeted at advanced users whose concern is
to squeeze every single drop of efficiency out of a SQL query.

The book layout follows the immortal ideas in "The Art of War", by Sun Tzu,
borrowing so heavily to become punctuated with precious quips and trivia about
war history and philosophy of problem solving. Stephane Faroult is not shying
away from showing dirty, real world SQL queries, pointing out how the query
optimizer might interpret them, how to differentiate between the relational and
the non-relational parts, and how to tackle common patterns of data. It can
almost be considered a "Design Patterns" for database design, in particular
chapter six ("The nine situations") and seven ("Variations in tactics")

If you are an advanced SQL user, or planning to become one, this book should
definitely be in your collection.
