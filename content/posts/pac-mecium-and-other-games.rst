This is a rather peculiar use of
`paramecia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramecium>`_: by directing
their preferential swimming movement by means of an applied electric
field (a property called
`galvanotaxis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxis#Galvanotaxis_.2F_electrotaxis>`_)
we can use them as player characters in videogames. I don't expect this
to become common gaming, though.
