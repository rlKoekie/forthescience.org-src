The earthquakes that recently hit my hometown and region triggered a
natural sequence of minor quakes. Thanks to the available data, I was
able to plot the 3d representation of the ipocenters. Red points
represent all the quakes from the start of the seismic sequence to the
3rd of June. Points in purple represent particularly strong quakes (5.0
or higher). Blue squares represent cities. I suggest to enable the 720p
version.
