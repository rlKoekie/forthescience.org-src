I want to integrate `OpenID <http://openid.net>`_ with the blog, but
apparently my current Wordpress version is not supported by the
`plugin <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/openid/>`_. I therefore
decided to upgrade to the most recent version. This means that some
hiccups could happen during the weekend. I hope everything rolls fine,
as I did quite a bit of customization on this Wordpress installation.
