This article at `New
Scientist <http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17699-microscopes-zoom-in-on-molecules-at-last.html>`_
brought me that fascinating excitement of what you already know, but you
really get to see for the very first time. A group at IBM Zurich was
able to produce incredibly resolved images of pentacene. Meet the
pentacene in traditional chemical structure:

And compare it with "`its photo <http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/ns/cms/dn17699/dn17699-1_300.jpg>`_ ".
Amazing! Of course, the `paper <http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1176210>`_ has been published on Science.
