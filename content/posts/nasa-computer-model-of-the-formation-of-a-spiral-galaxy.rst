I really love this movie (720p mode strongly suggested). It shows a
computational model for the formation of a spiral galaxy, from the big
bang to the present day.

Note how the galaxy shape at the beginning is rather similar to pictures
of young galaxies from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field

and how the galaxy inverts its rotation as it collides with other
galaxies.
