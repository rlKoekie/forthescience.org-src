I upgraded wordpress to 2.2.3. There are many attempts to exploit
vulnerabilities of previous versions in my logs, so I preferred to stay
up-to-date as much as I can on the 2.2 line. If any weird situation
jumps out, please let me know.

Of course, Merry Christmas and happy new year to all the (few, for now)
readers.
