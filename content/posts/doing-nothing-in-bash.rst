Today I had to "do nothing" in bash. In python you have "pass" for this
task. In C, you can use ";". I found `this
post <http://ynniv.com/blog/2005/04/doing-nothing-in-bash.html>`_ from
someone having the same issue. He proposes either "sleep 0" or "A=0".
However, looks like this is even nicer: from the bash manual

    : [arguments]
     No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding arguments
     and performing any specified redirections. A zero exit code is
     returned.

So, a simple ":" will do the trick.
