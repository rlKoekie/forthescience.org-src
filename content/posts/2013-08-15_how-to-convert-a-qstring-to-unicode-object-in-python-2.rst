I had this problem to solve, and I tried to find the safest way. This
program illustrates the solution

::

    from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui                                                                                                                       
    import sys                                                                                                                                            

    app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)                                                                                                                    
    ed = QtGui.QLineEdit()                                                                                                                                

    def editingFinished():                                                                                                                                
        # The text() returns a QString, which is unicode-aware                                                                                            
        print type(ed.text())                                                                                                                             
        # This returns a QByteArray, which is the encoded unicode string in the utf-8 encoding.                                                           
        print type(ed.text().toUtf8())                                                                                                                    
        # Since unicode() accepts a sequence of bytes, the safest and fully controlled way of performing                                                  
        # the transformation is to pass the encoded sequence of bytes, and let unicode know it is utf-8 encoded                                           
        print unicode(ed.text().toUtf8(), encoding="UTF-8")                                                                                               

    QtCore.QObject.connect(ed, QtCore.SIGNAL("editingFinished()"), editingFinished)                                                                       
    ed.show()                                                                                                                                             

    app.exec_()

So the solution is

::

    unicode(qstring_object.toUtf8(), encoding="UTF-8")

Maybe there's another, simpler way that it's also safe, but for now this
solution is good enough.
