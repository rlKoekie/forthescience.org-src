Due to future needs, I started studying an interesting language for
statistics, `R <http://www.r-project.org/>`_. It looks very intriguing,
and it has many ready to use functions for statistical and numerical
tasks. I am writing a quick reference for myself in the wiki. The page
is currently private, but if I can make it in proper shape I will
publish it.

Update: After a bit of cleanup, I made the `R quick
reference <http://forthescience.org/wiki/R%20quick%20reference>`_ page
available. It is a work in progress. Updates to this page will be done
according to my schedule in learning the language.
