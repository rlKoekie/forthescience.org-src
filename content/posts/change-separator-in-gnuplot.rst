Gnuplot is a great software. Very useful for easily plotting datapoints
without fuss and complicated interface. However, the default accepted
format is a table defined by space-separated values. If you have comma
separated values, then you have to change the delimiter. But how?

This command

::

    set datafile separator ","

will do the trick.
