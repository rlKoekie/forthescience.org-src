There can be cases when it's important to version file permissions. One
case I have at hand is to have a cache directory for automatically
generated images in a web application. The cache must be open for
writing by the webserver, because the images are generated via a PHP
script.

Unfortunately, subversion does not perform versioning of the file
permissions. As a result, when the cache directory is checked out, the
permissions are restricted to the user who checks out, and the webserver
cannot write content in the cache. There are some solutions to this
problem:

#. create a script that has to be run every time the tree is freshly
   checked out. The script checks the permission of critical directories
   and files, and put them correct. Advantages: quick to implement.
   Disadvantages: easy to forget, must be maintained for changes.
#. Use the `asvn
   wrapper <http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/asvn>`_
   to enhance subversion so that it can handle permissions via
   properties. Advantages: cleaner approach. Disadvantages: apparently
   none.
#. Let the webserver user check out the tree. Advantages: conceptually
   simple. Disadvantages: You have to have access to the webserver user,
   and if a security flaw is available, the webserver can potentially
   alter any file or write in any directory.

I'm sure there are other solutions, but I'm not aware of them at the
moment. My personal choice is for the first solution, mainly because I
don't want to bring asvn into the system right now. The script scales
appropriately for my current needs.
