I found this interesting question in the referral logs on ForTheScience.
Why is most science programming done in Fortran (77 or 95)?

After some thought, I can fill the following reasons:

-  Fortran is simple to understand. Not the code itself maybe, but the
   style. The learning curve for doing something in Fortran is very low,
   and after you manage the basic concepts, read and write, you can be
   proficient enough to write even complex computational application.
   Most scientists are not programmers, and they would be overwhelmed
   with the intricacies of C and C++. I would strongly prefer a
   non-programmer to code Fortran than, say, perl. In other words,
   Fortran just fits the need computational scientists have: read
   numbers, do a calculation, write the result, and everything can be
   taught to a profane in a standard semester course.
-  Fortran is computationally efficient. I will not go into the age old
   debate about "is Fortran really faster than C?", for which I have a
   rather articulate opinion I won't delve in. Instead, I will just
   present the fact that is indeed one of the languages whose compilers
   and computational libraries have been beaten to death for
   computational efficiency, being their marketing value.
-  Fortran is old. This has the effect of producing a huge amount of
   legacy code that have to be maintained or reused. Rewriting this code
   is normally not possible: who should do it? Even if this task
   requires just one man month in three years of Ph.D. contract, it will
   probably not produce a scientific publication, so nobody want the
   task. Moreover, the rewriting will likely ruin interfacing with other
   codes, programs and libraries, as well as the group knowledge (if
   any) of the code, so this move will almost always be opposed.
-  Fortran has a slow release cycle. Backward compatibility has been
   kept into account. Knowing that the code you wrote in the 80s will
   still compile today (or eventually you will have to add some compiler
   switch) make everyone happier. I am not sure you can run a perl or
   python program written 10 years ago and have it running today. I have
   no experience with C and C++ and old codes, so I am not completely
   sure about this point, and I welcome being proven wrong.

There are for sure many other reasons, but I won't go further.

Let's see instead why and when Fortran should not be used. My head goes
to python for most comparison:

-  Fortran has very reduced expressivity. You need a lot of code, often
   redundant, to code something. In some cases, you need to put stuff in
   temporary variables to pass the information to a subroutine,
   introducing more variables (difficult to maintain) or recycling old
   ones (bad).
-  Fortran (77, things are better in 95) makes very difficult to perform
   modular programming. Namespace pollution can be dramatic on large
   programs, especially considering the short identifier limit (not an
   issue on modern compilers, but in violation of the standard). Fortran
   95 modules are a step ahead, but you can't group modules into
   submodules.
-  Fortran (95) does not allow storage of function or subroutine
   pointers, making callback-oriented programming very hard.
-  Fortran (95) does not allow inheritance. `Smart workarounds
   exist <http://www.macresearch.org/advanced_fortran_90_callbacks_with_the_transfer_function>`_,
   but they require some skills and the base class develops a dependency
   towards derived ones.
-  Fortran has no polymorphism nor templating, making very painful to
   work on generic data types. Again, `workarounds exist, but they
   require external
   tools <http://www.macresearch.org/advanced_fortran_polymorphism_and_generic_programming>`_.
-  Fortran makes very difficult to keep loose coupling. A very strong
   dependency network arises. For large programs, the number of modules
   USEd (or the amount of code in them) may increase considerably.
   Compare with python, where a module does not need to be imported if
   you have to call a method on an object inside that module, or with
   C++, where you have forward declarations.
-  Fortran (95) does not have object orientation, it is very difficult,
   if not impossible, to use traditional design patterns.
-  Fortran does not have exceptions (F2003 will, but not custom ones, as
   far as I know).
-  Fortran has IMPLICIT. (Edit: yes, it has IMPLICIT NONE, but the
   existence of implicit declaration is unfortunately abused still
   today. It should have been deprecated.)
-  Fortran (77) does not have aggregated data types and dynamic memory
   allocation (in the standard)
-  Fortran strings are not dynamic in length (unless, if I remember
   correctly, if you do very weird hacks). A string of Length 100 and
   another of Length 101 are like being two different datatypes (say an
   int and a string), unless you use the LEN=\* in routine calls, but
   you cannot make more room to an allocated string if needed.
-  Fortran did not have clear interfacing with C, and every compiler did
   as it pleased. Apparently this is no longer true with the
   introduction of BIND.
-  No effective tools exist for documenting the code or easily perform
   Test Driven Development.
-  Libraries out there are targeted at computational tasks. I haven't
   seen any good library for GUI programming, networking, db access, and
   even if you could, would you ?
-  Fortran is full of unusual pitfalls for anyone used to a different
   language. While pitfalls exist in any language, Fortran has pitfalls
   coming from compatibility towards older improper use (e.g. automatic
   SAVE in assignment at declaration). In some other cases though,
   pitfalls are due to the highly optimized nature of the language.
   These pitfalls are in general a strong deviation from the behavior of
   any other language using the similar constructs.
-  Most of the code out there uses old code. Even if the language
   progressed, you will still find ancient remains of code written when
   the main writing method was a stick on a clay table. This code will
   most likely be impossible to refactor.

This is just out of the top of my head, and I am sure there is a lot
more. In any case, Fortran 2003 seems to alleviate most of the problems
outlined above. In particular, it will have object oriented programming,
and function/subroutine pointers. A considerable step forward.

Please note that I wasn't a Fortran fan, but with time I became tolerant
to it. It should be used sparingly and only where the need exist, or if
a real reason exists: use high level programming languages with good
expressivity first, such as Python. Then eventually optimize where
needed, sometimes with a drop of Fortran, but only if you really, really
(yes, I mean **really**) need it.
