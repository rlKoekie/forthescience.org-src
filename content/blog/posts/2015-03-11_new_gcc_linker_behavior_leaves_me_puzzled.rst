New gcc linker behavior leaves me puzzled

Today, together with a colleague, I found out this interesting behavior of the
GNU linker.  Suppose you define the following trivial (and incorrect, but who
cares) program

.. code-block:: c

    int main() {}

if you link it and specify a library (say, libm) it does not depend on, the
final executable does not depend on that library. This is a good thing, because
there's no point in having a dependency against a library if you don't use any
part of it. 

.. code-block:: console

    sbo@NAS:~$ gcc test.c -o test -lm
    sbo@NAS:~$ ldd test
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff673ff000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007ff5cc6a4000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007ff5cca83000)

This was not always the case. In old versions of the linker the result would have been 

.. code-block:: console

    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff317bc000)
    libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007fb5d9d13000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb5d9953000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb5da02e000)

occasionally resulting in spurious dependencies. The linker would have added an
entry to the ELF dynamic section, regardless of the actual need for that
library.

.. code-block:: console

    sbo@NAS:~$ readelf --dynamic test

    Dynamic section at offset 0xe40 contains 21 entries:
      Tag        Type                         Name/Value
     0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libm.so.6]
     0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]

To prevent the addition of libraries when no symbols from those libraries are actually used,
a flag --as-needed was introduced to the linker. It wasn't enabled by default, but in gcc 4.6 it is.
In gcc 4.2 it was not. One can always restore the old behavior by issuing --no-as-needed

.. code-block:: console

    gcc test.c -o test -Wl,--no-as-needed -lm
