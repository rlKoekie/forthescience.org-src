Naming for conversion routines

I love code that self-documents and reads naturally, so I strive to name my
routines and variables appropriately. When you are faced with the
implementation of a conversion method, in generally the name is in the form
"toB", where B is the result of the conversion, for example

.. code-block:: python 
    
    rgb_values = color.toRgb()

The inverse, when we want to convert and integrate the conversion into an
object's internal state, is generally in the form "fromB"

.. code-block:: python 
    
    color.fromRgb(rgb_values)

When you have a conversion function, things are slightly different: "From"
assumes a different weight and meaning. To perform a conversion color object
to rgb you can use either

.. code-block:: python 
    
    rgb_values = colorToRgb(color)

or

.. code-block:: python 

    rgb_values = rgbFromColor(color)

The second works best because the proximity and order of the terms resembles
the one naturally established by the prepended nature of the routine call and
the order of the two objects. Everything moves from right to left in the second
example, and it reads naturally. The first solution is clumsier and
disorganized. Similarly, the reverse conversion will be

.. code-block:: python 

    color = colorFromRgb(rgb_values)

The conclusion is that when you write a conversion function, prefer the "From"
naming exclusively, while for methods you can use "To" and "From" forms for
different conversion directions.
