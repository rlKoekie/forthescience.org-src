Simulating network problems on OSX

Recently I had to simulate unreliable connections to a remote server, for
testing purposes. I needed two cases: a fully unreachable host, and a host with
considerable packet loss and delay. The first is easy to achieve: just pull the
cable. For the second, I had to google up, as my network-fu is a bit rusty on
the latest developments, especially on OSX. I am more of a Linux guy when it
comes to networking.

A quick search produced `this blog
<http://www.joemiller.me/2010/08/31/simulate-network-latency-packet-loss-and-bandwidth-on-mac-osx/>`_,
with great details on how to achieve my needs. I copy the details here for
future reference. 

Here I add a 1 second delay and a 0.4 packet loss in both directions

.. code-block:: console

    bash-3.2# ipfw add pipe 1 ip from any to 10.0.0.1
    00100 pipe 1 ip from any to 10.0.0.1

    bash-3.2# ipfw add pipe 1 ip from 10.0.0.1 to any
    00200 pipe 1 ip from any to any src-ip 10.0.0.1

    bash-3.2# ipfw pipe 1 config delay 1000ms plr 0.4
    bash-3.2# ipfw pipe 2 config delay 1000ms plr 0.4

    bash-3.2# ping 10.0.0.1
    PING 10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
    Request timeout for icmp_seq 0
    64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=2000.386 ms

This is really harsh, but it is what I need. 

The ``ipfw`` utility is the traditional FreeBSD packet filter. The amount of
power behind this little command is impressive and reminds me of Linux
``iptables``. ``ipfw`` has been deprecated in OSX 10.9 in favor of ``pfctl``.
Similarly, ``iptables`` is going to be deprecated on Linux in favor of
``nftables``.
