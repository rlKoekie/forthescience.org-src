From URI to ontologies

It is some sort of well known pattern, the "``http://``" stuff. It is so
frequently used that browsers just fill it in automatically by default.
But what does exactly mean? What's behind it? In reality, behind a so
called URI, there's more than meets the eye.

What is an URI?
---------------

First of all, we need some definition. an **URI**, or Uniform Resource
Identifier, is a string identifier that, as the name implies, identifies
some **resource**. A resource is "something" that can be referred to. It
could be an internet document, a book, whatever. The official definition
of an URI is detailed in its latest form in `RFC
3986 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`_.

The URI is made of the following parts:

#. A scheme
#. A hierarchical part
#. Optionally, a query
#. Optionally, a fragment

Some URIs can be URLs (Locators) or URNs (Names). Both are URIs, but the
URL identifies a resource **and** the place where to find the resource,
while a URN describes a name of a resource through the special scheme
name ``urn:``. When you type an address in your browser, you are specifying
a URL. When you talk about ``urn:isbn:0-395-36341-1``, you are using a URN
to talk about a book with a specific
`ISBN <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN>`_. Please note that the
relationship is not bijective: although every URL is a URI, not all URIs
are URLs, and the same can be said for URNs instead of URL.

Although many scheme names are named after protocols (eg. http, ftp,
ldap) this is mostly incidental. There is no "technical correspondence"
between the scheme and the protocol: for example by saying a URI with
the scheme name http, trying to get the resource (therefore assuming the
URI is also a location) will trigger not only HTTP, but also DNS.
Moreover, if you have the document in cache, you will not use HTTP at
all, but you will get a resource that is on your hard drive. "Resolving"
a URI means finding an access strategy to "use" (in very broad term) the
resource identified by that URI, an operation called "dereference". The
most common dereferencing is retrieval, like downloading the resource.

The hierarchical part includes either an authority and a path, or just a
path. Please note that the "path" concept is very loose: for example, in
``mailto:user@example.com``, the ``user@example.com`` is a path. Similarly, in
``urn:isbn:0-395-36341-1``, the path is ``isbn:0-395-36341-1`` (which
corresponds to the Webster Dictionary, in case you are wondering). When
you have an authority involved for the resolution of the path, and only
in this case, then you have the "//" to indicate the authority, for
example ``http://example.com/foo/bar``, where the authority is
``example.com`` and the path is ``/foo/bar``. An apparent exception is
``telnet://example.com``, but in any case you do have an authority, and
the path is always empty. Another apparent strange situation is
``mailto:user@example.com``: in this case, be careful not to confuse a
path with an authority (maybe user qualified, as in
``http://user@host/``).

What can you use URIs for ?
---------------------------

So, what does the distinction of URI, URL and URN is really useful for?
The fact is that, while a URL refers to a "place" where to find a
resource, a URN refers to a "name"of a resource in the urn scheme, and a
URI as a name of a resource in any scheme. When we talk about resource,
the meaning is very broad. It could be anything, even an abstract
concept. An example is the definition of namespaces in XML, something
like

.. code-block:: xml

    <h:html xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
     <h:head><h:title>Hello!</h:title></h:head>
     <h:body>
       <h:h1>Big Title</h:h1>
     </h:body>
    </h:html>

The URI ``http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml`` is just an URI. It is not a
location (the fact that W3C is actually using the address to provide an
informative page can be seen as a coincidence). It is a symbol to mean
something, namely, the fact that some elements in that XML documents
belong to the vocabulary of XHTML.

In `Chestnut package manager <http://chestnut.sourceforge.net>`_, the
XML manifest starts with

.. code-block:: xml

    <Package xmlns="urn:uuid:d195be0c-200a-40a4-9d05-35fdf42eb29f" version="1.0.0">

Where the URI ``urn:uuid:d195be0c-200a-40a4-9d05-35fdf42eb29f`` again
means something: the fact that the "grammar" used is the one of Chestnut
package manager. I created this URI with the utility uuidgen, and by
definition is a unique id. I could have used anything else, even the URI
of this post. The important point is that it has to be a URI, and has to
be unique for this specific use. In this particular case, the URI is
also a URN.

Another interesting usage of URIs is in ontologies and RDF descriptions.
Briefly and roughly, an ontology is a "description of a world". Suppose
that you want to describe the following information

::

    my guitar is white

and you want a computer to be able to understand it. Moreover, you would
like to make the computer understand that the guitar is a musical
instrument

::

    The guitar is a musical instrument

and that white is a color

::

    white is a color

Now, if you ask the computer to search all the musical instruments that
are white, you would like to get my guitar, because it is white, and
because it is a musical instrument. Seems easy, but it's not. The fact
is that humans are very smart at interpreting those phrases, but a
computer is not. `Quoting Bill
Clinton <http://politicalhumor.about.com/cs/quotethis/a/clintonquotes.htm>`_,
it depends on what the meaning of "is" is. By saying ``my guitar is
white`` we describe a property of the guitar, specifically its color. We
have a **subject** (``my guitar``), a **verb** (``is``, in terms of ``has color``) and
a **predicate** (``white``). This is also known as a **triplet**, and is the
basis of
`RDF <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework>`_.

Of course, if we take ``the guitar is a musical instrument`` we have again
a case of triplet: ``the guitar`` is the subject, ``is a`` in terms of ``is a
kind of`` is the verb, and ``musical instrument`` is the predicate. Please
note that we have another interesting fact here: while ``my guitar`` is a
very specific guitar (that is, the guitar I own), ``the guitar`` is an
abstract concept that applies to any guitar. They are not the same
thing, they are two different concepts, but we can say without doubt
that ``my guitar (the first concept) is a guitar (the second
concept)``. This is a case of instance/class relationship.

We can form very complex networks of subject-verb-predicate triplets
describing the digital and non-digital world we live in, so that a
computer can help us in doing complex search and analysis. How do we
differentiate all the concepts and ambiguities we just encountered? You
guessed it: with URIs. We will have a URI to express the concept of ``my
guitar``, another URI to express the concept of ``white``, another URI to
express the concept of ``guitar``, ``musical instrument``, ``color``, and we
will also have different URIs expressing the concepts of ``is (as a
color)`` and ``is (a kind of)``. All these concepts are part of the
description (also known as **ontology**) we want to grant to the small world
we created in this example. This description is rather simple and loose,
but we can define way more complex ontologies. For example, we can
create a color ontology, describing the colors and their relationships:

::

    white is a color
    red is a color
    snow white is a kind of white
    blood red is a kind of red
    red is a warm color
    blue is a cold color

or an instrument ontology describing

::

    guitar is a six-string instrument
    violin is a four-string instrument
    four-string instrument is a string instrument
    six-string instrument is a string instrument
    string instrument is a musical instrument

Each of these concepts (``guitar``, ``six-string instrument``, ``violin``,
``four-string instrument``, ``string instrument``, ``musical instrument``)
will then be referred by means of a unique URI.

I hope I gave a reasonable and down-to-earth introduction to URIs and
Ontologies, what they mean and represent, and what they can be used for.
As usual, you are welcome to comment.
