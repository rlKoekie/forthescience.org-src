Calling a C routine from python, the easy way

I think it may be interesting for others to see how to call easily a C
routine from python, without implementing a python module. What you need
is the ctypes module. Remeber however that apparently the use of this
module is generally frowned upon, at least according to a note I found
in `PEP 399 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0399/>`_:

*Usage of ``ctypes`` to provide an API for a C library will continue to
be frowned upon as ``ctypes`` lacks compiler guarantees that C code
typically relies upon to prevent certain errors from occurring (e.g.,
API changes).*

although to be honest, it may be in the context of the PEP itself, and
not as a general recommendation.

Nevertheless, suppose you want to call the function

.. code-block:: c

    double pow(double, double)

in the standard math library.

The first thing to do is to define the prototype of the function. You
achieve this via the following:

.. code-block:: python

    prototype=ctypes.CFUNCTYPE(ctypes.c_double, ctypes.c_double, ctypes.c_double)

The call to ctypes.CFUNCTYPE creates a prototype object for a C function
that returns a double (the first argument) and accepts two double (the
second and third arguments).

Now you have a prototype. This entity is a class

.. code-block:: python

    >>> prototype
    <class 'ctypes.CFunctionType'>

and you can bind this prototype to the actual function in the math
library with the following. First you create an object representing the
library

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dll=ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary("libm.dylib") # on Mac. Linux use libm.so

and then you bind to the actual function

.. code-block:: python

    >>> pow = prototype(("pow", dll))
    >>> pow(3,4)
    81.0

This just brushes the surface, but I wanted to make a simple introductory post.
