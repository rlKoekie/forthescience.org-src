Beautiful Git rebasing of version branch

In this post, I want to share with you a technique I learned recently from a colleague.
It's a really great trick to keep your history nice and clean, while being able to work
and push feature branches.

Let's start with the workflow and the problem that generates. You have a master branch
that is pushed to a remote, containing the following

.. code-block:: text

    * f2bc01d 2014-10-07 17:57:52 +0200 Stefano Borini (HEAD, origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) - added 5 to foo
    * 2ecacd7 2014-10-07 17:57:52 +0200 Stefano Borini - added 4 to foo
    * d0f53d8 2014-10-07 17:57:52 +0200 Stefano Borini - added 3 to foo
    * d26a4db 2014-10-07 17:57:52 +0200 Stefano Borini - added 2 to foo
    * f98ef63 2014-10-07 17:57:52 +0200 Stefano Borini - added 1 to foo
    * d817b10 2014-10-07 17:57:04 +0200 Stefano Borini - Added foo
    * 5fdec88 2014-10-07 17:50:00 +0200 Stefano Borini - Initial commit

You want to work on a feature, so you create a feature branch from the current master 

.. code-block:: console

    sbo@NAS:~/tmp/git-experiment-1$ git checkout -b feature
    Switched to a new branch 'feature'
    sbo@NAS:~/tmp/git-experiment-1$ git push --set-upstream origin feature
    Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To git@github.com:stefanoborini/git-experiment-1.git
     * [new branch]      feature -> feature

Master keeps receiving patches from other developers. At the same time, you keep pushing your
feature changes to your remote, because you don't want to risk losing all your work if 
your hard drive crashes. The situation ends up like this

.. code-block:: text

Now you have a problem. If you merge feature back into master, you will get a very long line connecting
your last commit on feature back to the current master. This may seem trivial, but in complex
scenarios it can become unpleasant to browse. 

You may think that rebasing is the solution, but unfortunately, you would
introduce a lot of problems if you do so. The Feature branch is already pushed
to remote, and it's on all developers' machines. Rebasing would mean force a push and 
rewrite history, with ugly consequences. 

What you would like to do is to "cherry pick" all the commits from feature on top
of your current master, but there's a more elegant way of doing it. First of all,
checkout your feature branch

.. code-block:: console

    sbo@NAS:~/tmp/git-experiment-1$ git checkout feature
    Switched to branch 'feature'

Then, create and checkout a local branch from the feature branch

.. code-block:: console

    sbo@NAS:~/tmp/git-experiment-1$ git checkout -b feature_rebaser
    Switched to a new branch 'feature_rebaser'

Now, rebase this branch against the current master. This migrates all the patches
from feature_rebaser to master, but only locally. 

.. code-block:: console

    sbo@NAS:~/tmp/git-experiment-1$ git rebase master
    First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
    Applying: added 1 to bar
    Applying: added 2 to bar
    Applying: added 3 to bar
    Applying: added 4 to bar
    Applying: added 5 to bar

And finally, you can merge onto master. You can use --no-ff to keep the patches
"visually separated" instead of in continuity with the current master timeline.

.. code-block:: console

    sbo@NAS:~/tmp/git-experiment-1$ git checkout master
    Switched to branch 'master'
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    sbo@NAS:~/tmp/git-experiment-1$ git merge --no-ff feature_rebaser 

The resulting tree is the following

.. code-block:: text

Note how the feature branch is now "brought to present day" and inserts nice and easy.
The feature branch can then be left dangling and deleted at your best convenience.

Coudn't we just rebase feature, instead of creating a new branch? Unfortunately no.
I created the same situation with a new branch "feature2", pushed it to remote,
and rebased feature2. Checking out master and then back to feature2 I get

.. code-block:: console

    sbo@NAS:~/tmp/git-experiment-1$ git checkout feature2
    Switched to branch 'feature2'
    Your branch and 'origin/feature2' have diverged,
    and have 15 and 5 different commits each, respectively.
      (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

oops... I changed history on my local machine, and this differs from the
situation that is on the remote server. If you pull now, you will apply the
same patches twice

.. code-block:: console

    sbo@NAS:~/tmp/git-experiment-1$ git pull
    Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

with the following tree

Git is unable to recognize the patches' duplication, because rebasing changes
the SHA. In this case, it went smooth, but in a real-case scenario, you would
get plenty of conflicts.
