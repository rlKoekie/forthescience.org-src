Scrambling the stack for fun and profit

Like any good respected tinkerer, I sometimes like to play with the madness and
intricacies of the hardware and software I use. Recently I was tracing
problems in a software I won't name but whose objective is to prevent tampering
attempts, and while dumping stacks and disassembling routines, I came around
this very interesting backtrace ::

   #0  0x0000003f95e0d654 in __lll_lock_wait () from /lib64/libpthread.so.0
   #1  0x0000003f95e08f65 in _L_lock_1127 () from /lib64/libpthread.so.0
   #2  0x0000003f95e08e63 in pthread_mutex_lock () from /lib64/libpthread.so.0
   #3  0x00002b67cbdeaded in ?? ()
   #4  0x000000002d0e9608 in ?? ()
   #5  0x00002b67cbd1e1f2 in ?? ()
   #6  0x000000000000000b in ?? ()
   #7  0x00002aaaca08e410 in ?? ()
   #8  0x00002aaab405d558 in ?? ()
   #9  0x00002aaaadf65f48 in ?? ()
   #10 0x00002aaaadf65fa0 in ?? ()
   #11 0x00002aaaadf65fc0 in ?? ()
   #12 0x00002aaaadf65f40 in ?? ()
   #13 0x00002aaaadf65f50 in ?? ()
   #14 0x000000002d0e7460 in ?? ()
   #15 0x0000000026014330 in ?? ()
   #16 0x00002b67cc1d08b0 in ?? ()

Interesting, I said to myself. I had no idea why I didn't have any backtrace
information. What's interesting is that the addresses appeared to be incorrect,
or not pointing to any code section. Note for example #6. I hardly doubt that's
a correct address. I had no idea why this happened.

Nevertheless, I eventually found what I was looking for and moved on to other
things, but the weird stack remained in the back of my head. Could it be that
the stack has been scrambled on purpose? Maybe... or maybe the library was just
stripped? Then why the weird address at frame #6? I still don't know, but the
idea of scrambling the stack was appealing. So I wrote this trivial program as
a proof of concept, just for fun

.. code-block:: c

   #include <stdio.h>

   int routine4() {
       printf("hello\n");
   }
   int routine3() {
       routine4();
   }
   int routine2() {
       routine3();
   }
   int routine1() {
       routine2();
   }
   int main() {
       routine1();
   }

then I compiled it with a simple g++ file.cpp, set a breakpoint on routine4,
ran it, and asked for a backtrace ::

   #0  0x0000000100000e18 in routine4 ()
   #1  0x0000000100000e2f in routine3 ()
   #2  0x0000000100000e3a in routine2 ()
   #3  0x0000000100000e45 in routine1 ()
   #4  0x0000000100000e50 in main ()

Pretty nice backtrace. We see the full information and all routine names. If we
disassemble routine4, we also see the printf, which is actually reworked into a
puts on OSX 10.6.8 with gcc.::

   0x0000000100000e14 <_z8routine4v +0>:	push   %rbp
   0x0000000100000e15 <_z8routine4v +1>:	mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x0000000100000e18 <_z8routine4v +4>:	lea    0x45(%rip),%rdi        # 0x100000e64
   0x0000000100000e1f <_z8routine4v +11>:	callq  0x100000e5e <dyld_stub_puts>
   0x0000000100000e24 <_z8routine4v +16>:	leaveq 
   0x0000000100000e25 <_z8routine4v +17>:	retq

If I instead strip the binary with strip a.out, I can't set a breakpoint on
routine4 anymore, and rightly so::

   (gdb) break routine4
   Function "routine4" not defined.
   Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) n
   (gdb) break puts
   Breakpoint 1 at 0x3126e978c12ef0

Thanks to strip, all symbols are gone and the debugger can only refer to
addresses. I can only guess (but not a hard one) where the code is, by checking
at which VM pages they are mapped to, and the entry point::

   (gdb) info file
   Symbols from "/Users/sbo/tmp/a.out".
   Mac OS X executable:
      /Users/sbo/tmp/a.out, file type mach-o-le.
      Entry point: 0x0000000100000dd8
      0x0000000100000000 - 0x0000000100001000 is LC_SEGMENT.__TEXT in /Users/sbo/tmp/a.out
      0x0000000100000dd8 - 0x0000000100000e57 is LC_SEGMENT.__TEXT.__text in /Users/sbo/tmp/a.out

In any case, with the breakpoint at puts I can get to the printf and issue a
backtrace to get to our infamous condition ::

   #0  0x00007fff86eb0ef0 in puts ()
   #1  0x0000000100000e24 in ?? ()
   #2  0x0000000100000e2f in ?? ()
   #3  0x0000000100000e3a in ?? ()
   #4  0x0000000100000e45 in ?? ()
   #5  0x0000000100000e50 in ?? ()
   #6  0x0000000100000e0c in ?? ()

Yet, as you can see, the stack makes sense. I cannot disassemble, but at least
I can dump the contents and they make sense ::

   (gdb) disas 0x0000000100000e24
   No function contains specified address.
   (gdb) x/30i  0x0000000100000e24
   0x100000e24:	leaveq 
   0x100000e25:	retq   
   0x100000e26:	push   %rbp
   0x100000e27:	mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x100000e2a:	callq  0x100000e14
   0x100000e2f:	leaveq 
   0x100000e30:	retq   
   0x100000e31:	push   %rbp
   0x100000e32:	mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x100000e35:	callq  0x100000e26
   0x100000e3a:	leaveq 
   0x100000e3b:	retq   
   0x100000e3c:	push   %rbp
   0x100000e3d:	mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x100000e40:	callq  0x100000e31
   0x100000e45:	leaveq 
   0x100000e46:	retq   
   0x100000e47:	push   %rbp
   0x100000e48:	mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x100000e4b:	callq  0x100000e3c
   0x100000e50:	mov    $0x0,%eax
   0x100000e55:	leaveq 
   0x100000e56:	retq

In fact, you can see the whole shebang. All the calls of the routines, the
stack pointer changes, and the final setting to zero of eax when main ends.

Scrambling the return address
-----------------------------

Here is the idea: Instead of `smashing the stack
<http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html>`_, I will try to scramble it.
What does it mean? Well, let's see how the stack is when we are just about to
be calling puts. We select the previous frame ::

   (gdb) frame 1
   #1  0x0000000100000e24 in ?? ()

Get the stack pointer at the current frame ::

   (gdb) info registers
   ...snip...
   rbp            0x7fff5fbff680	0x7fff5fbff680
   rsp            0x7fff5fbff680	0x7fff5fbff680
   ...snip...

Then we take a look at what is in there ::

   (gdb) x/10a 0x7fff5fbff680
   0x7fff5fbff680:	0x7fff5fbff690	0x100000e2f
   0x7fff5fbff690:	0x7fff5fbff6a0	0x100000e3a
   0x7fff5fbff6a0:	0x7fff5fbff6b0	0x100000e45
   0x7fff5fbff6b0:	0x7fff5fbff6c0	0x100000e50
   0x7fff5fbff6c0:	0x7fff5fbff6d8	0x100000e0c
   (gdb) bt
   #0  0x00007fff86eb0ef0 in puts ()
   #1  0x0000000100000e24 in ?? ()
   #2  0x0000000100000e2f in ?? ()
   #3  0x0000000100000e3a in ?? ()
   #4  0x0000000100000e45 in ?? ()
   #5  0x0000000100000e50 in ?? ()
   #6  0x0000000100000e0c in ?? ()

Nothing unusual, it's simply the stack pointer and the return address,
traditional stack contents for a routine call. When the routine returns, the
old return address will be restored to the rip, and the program will continue
where it left off, at the routine call. If we were to change this address in
the stack, the program would jump to a different location, and that would be
bad and likely lead to a crash. Note however that, in order for the stack to
unwind correctly, only the frame below the current one is needed, and it's
needed just before the return occurs.

So, we can technically scramble all the stack, set those addresses to something
else and completely break the backtrace even of a non-stripped binary, provided
that we restore the frame under the current one just before returning. The
process will be:

   #. Inside every routine, we will drop at the assembly level and write a
      prologue section where we alter the underlying frame's return address.
   #. We do our thing inside the routine
   #. Again at the assembly level, we write an epilogue section where we
      restore the return address, just before issuing the return that needs it.

With this strategy in place, if you break anywhere inside the function all the
frames (except the one your code is currently in) will be "scrambled" and
pointing at nonsensical memory areas. Despite the completely trashed stack, the
program will behave correctly because when those addresses will be needed at
return, the right address has been restored just a few instructions earlier.
Let's see:

.. code-block:: c
   
   int routine4() {
       asm("mov 8(%rsp), %rbx"); 
       asm("lea 0xdeeead(,%rbx,), %rbx");
       asm("mov %rbx, 8(%rsp)");
       printf("hello\n");
       asm("mov 8(%rsp), %rbx");
       asm("lea -0xdeeead(,%rbx,), %rbx");
       asm("mov %rbx, 8(%rsp)");
   }

I altered the routine to perform the prologue and the epilogue. In the
prologue, I extract the content of the stack pointer plus 8, which happens to
be the return address. I put this value in rbx as it seems to be unused. Then,
with lea, I add a fixed offset (oxdeeead) to the content of rbx. Finally, I
write this value back in the stack at %rsp+8.  In the epilogue, I simply
perform the opposite operation, subtracting 0xdeeead and restoring the correct
return address in the stack. If I compile and run, the program works correctly.

The gdb session is really nice::

   Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000100000df4 in routine4 ()
   (gdb) bt
   #0  0x0000000100000df4 in routine4 ()
   #1  0x0000000100000e2f in routine3 ()
   #2  0x0000000100000e3a in routine2 ()
   #3  0x0000000100000e45 in routine1 ()
   #4  0x0000000100000e50 in main ()

Note how the stack is correct, as we haven't executed the prologue yet. ::

   (gdb) disas

   Dump of assembler code for function _Z8routine4v:
   0x0000000100000df0 <_z8routine4v +0>:	push   %rbp

   0x0000000100000e25 <_z8routine4v +53>:	retq   
   End of assembler dump.

The current situation looks like this::

   (gdb) info register
   rbx            0x0	0
   rsp            0x7fff5fbff680	0x7fff5fbff680
   (gdb) x/10a 0x7fff5fbff680
   0x7fff5fbff680:	0x7fff5fbff690	0x100000e2f <_z8routine3v +9>
   0x7fff5fbff690:	0x7fff5fbff6a0	0x100000e3a <_z8routine2v +9>
   0x7fff5fbff6a0:	0x7fff5fbff6b0	0x100000e45 <_z8routine1v +9>
   0x7fff5fbff6b0:	0x7fff5fbff6c0	0x100000e50

Stepping instruction after instruction, we can follow the events: first the rbx
register is filled with the return address from the stack::

   -> mov    0x8(%rsp),%rbx
   (gdb) info register rbx 
   rbx 0x100000e2f 4294970927

Then, we add 0xdeeead ::

   -> lea    0xdeeead(,%rbx,1),%rbx
   (gdb) info register rbx
   rbx            0x100defcdc	4309581020

and finally, we store it back into the stack ::

   -> mov    %rbx,0x8(%rsp)           # prologue
   (gdb) x/10a 0x7fff5fbff680
   0x7fff5fbff680:	0x7fff5fbff690	0x100defcdc
   0x7fff5fbff690:	0x7fff5fbff6a0	0x100000e3a <_z8routine2v +9>
   0x7fff5fbff6a0:	0x7fff5fbff6b0	0x100000e45 <_z8routine1v +9>
   0x7fff5fbff6b0:	0x7fff5fbff6c0	0x100000e50

Et voila'. The backtrace is now pointing to neverland ::

   (gdb) bt
   #0  0x0000000100000e06 in routine4 ()
   #1  0x0000000100defcdc in ?? ()
   #2  0x0000000100000e3a in routine2 ()
   #3  0x0000000100000e45 in routine1 ()
   #4  0x0000000100000e50 in main ()

If we were to return now, a segfault would occur: that return address is
completely invalid. It's only by performing the reverse operation that we can
land safely back into routine3 ::

   -> mov    0x8(%rsp),%rbx
   rbx            0x100defcdc
   -> lea    -0xdeeead(,%rbx,1),%rbx  
   rbx            0x100000e2f	
   -> mov    %rbx,0x8(%rsp)         
   Stack 0x7fff5fbff680:	0x7fff5fbff690	0x100000e2f <_z8routine3v +9>

Now the backtrace is sane again and we are ready to return ::

   (gdb) bt
   #0  0x0000000100000e24 in routine4 ()
   #1  0x0000000100000e2f in routine3 ()
   #2  0x0000000100000e3a in routine2 ()
   #3  0x0000000100000e45 in routine1 ()
   #4  0x0000000100000e50 in main ()

Now that we can reliably alter the stack frame, we can apply the same trick to
our complete call hierarchy. Here is the full code:

.. code-block:: c

   #include <stdio.h>

   #define scramble() asm("mov 8(%rsp), %rbx"); \
                       asm("lea 0xdead(,%rbx,), %rbx"); \
                       asm("mov %rbx, 8(%rsp)")

   #define unscramble() asm("mov 8(%rsp), %rbx"); \
                        asm("lea -0xdead(,%rbx,), %rbx"); \
                        asm("mov %rbx, 8(%rsp)")
   int routine4() {
       scramble();
       printf("hello\n");
       unscramble();
   }
   int routine3() {
       scramble();
       routine4();
       unscramble();
   }
   int routine2() {
       scramble();
       routine3();
       unscramble();
   }
   int routine1() {
       scramble();
       routine2();
       unscramble();
   }
   int main() {
       scramble();
       routine1();
       unscramble();
   }

If you compile it, it runs ::

   sbo@sbos-macbook:~/tmp$ g++ test.cpp 
   sbo@sbos-macbook:~/tmp$ ./a.out 
   hello

and if you debug it, break at puts, and backtrace, here is the funny result::

   (gdb) bt
   #0  0x00007fff86eb0ef0 in puts ()
   #1  0x0000000100000d82 in routine4 ()
   #2  0x0000000100defc5e in ?? ()
   #3  0x0000000100defc8d in ?? ()
   #4  0x0000000100defcbc in ?? ()
   #5  0x0000000100defceb in ?? ()
   #6  0x0000000100defc05 in ?? ()
   (gdb) x/10a 0x0000000100defc8d
   0x100defc8d:	Cannot access memory at address 0x100defc8d
   (gdb) disas 0x0000000100defc8d
   No function contains specified address.
   (gdb) cont
   Continuing.
   hello

   Program exited normally.

Now you can get creative. For example, you can
   
   * Scramble your frames according to a random number that you seed
     differently at every new run.
   * Scramble the whole frame content, not only the return address
   * Spread out preamble and epilogue throughout the routine code, so that it's
     harder to find out which opcode is devoted to actual execution, and which
     one is unscrambling the frame, maybe through tortuous operations full of
     indirections.

Of course, this stuff is extremely hard to do correctly. You have to keep into
account that some stack content could be needed by callees, so you may have to
unscramble any frame content at any time. It can also quickly turn into a
portability nightmare, as different compilers may have different strategies to
fill the stack with local variables.

Yet, it was fun, and I hope you enjoyed it.
