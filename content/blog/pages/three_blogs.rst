Three blogs

I have three blogs, mostly because I like to keep things organized:

    - the `main blog <http://forthescience.org/blog/>`_, where the focus is on computer programming, particularly scientific programming.
      If a post does not contain code, it won't go here.
    - the `gaia blog <http://forthescience.org/gaia/>`_ where I write mostly about outdoor and nature-oriented activities, such as beekeeping.
    - the `whatever blog <http://forthescience.org/whatever/>`_ where I put everything else, generally science related but not necessarily.
