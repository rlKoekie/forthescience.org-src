I just received notification that the hives of our association were
completely destroyed by the storm that hit Denmark yesterday.

Considering the current freezing temperatures, it's very, very unlikely
the bees will survive. The take-home message of this sad experience is
that if you live in a place prone to heavy wind, a simple brick might
not be enough to protect your hives. You should look for more
appropriate solutions.
